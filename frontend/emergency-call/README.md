## Inspiration
Emergencies can happen anytime, and seconds matter when seeking help. We wanted to create a simple yet powerful tool that ensures instant emergency response, real-time location sharing, and distress alerts to keep people safe.

## What it does
VigilWatch enables users to:

- Instantly call emergency services with one tap
- Share live location with trusted contacts
- Send distress alerts via SMS to pre-selected contacts
- Store critical medical information for first responders
- Verify officials & medical professionals for reliable assistance

## How we built it
We developed VigilWatch using:

- React & Chakra UI for an intuitive, responsive front-end
- Firebase/Auth for secure user authentication
- Geolocation APIs to enable real-time location tracking
- Twilio API for emergency SMS alerts
- Node.js & Express (if applicable) for backend functionalities

## Challenges we ran into
- Real-time location sharing: Ensuring accuracy and security while integrating GPS data
- Authentication & verification: Implementing ID and medical license verification for officials
- Efficient UI/UX: Balancing simplicity with advanced features to avoid overwhelming users

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully built an intuitive, user-friendly emergency response system
- Integrated real-time location tracking & SMS alerts for fast communication
- Created a verified emergency network for officials and medical personnel
- Ensured privacy & security in handling sensitive user data

## What we learned
- User experience is crucial in emergencies – A clutter-free, intuitive UI significantly improves response times.

- Security and privacy are essential – Handling sensitive medical and personal data requires strict encryption and compliance.

- Scalability matters – Building a system that can handle a growing number of users without latency issues is key.

- Collaboration drives innovation – Working together helped us solve technical roadblocks and refine our vision faster.

## What's next for VigilWatch
The plan for the future is to improve the app and make it more efficient, accessible, and user friendly. We were not able to get it working on iOS, so we plan to implement that in the future. Find a way to verify officials efficiently. An AI chatbot integration for less urgent situations.
